cgis: a simple in-directory, local, appserver

The general idea is to be something akin to XSP for C# or the simple python
HTTP server which server applications from their respective languages. I
wanted a drop in program to server general purpose CGI programs. The way it
looks currently, I will only be implementing exactly what I need. This means
no proper HTTP support (may the RFC gods never find out), and the interface
with the application won't exactly be CGI.

If you would like to see proper support for something, let me know or submit a
patch. It's a hobby project, so eventually I will actually follow the RFCs for
various things. Hence, let me know what you want so it can be bumped up the
list.

Building:
	Currently, you'll want to edit src/cgis.c to change some constants like
	port and application binary name.

	Then simply run:
		make

	Since the program is in the initial stages of development, this creates a
	debug enabled build. You can look through the Makefile (it's really not
	that long) to see what you should define to make a release/other build.

Running:
	./cgis # note, you may want to copy this to ~/bin, or your application
		# directory. I do not recommend really installing it at this time
